"""Derived definitions from SPEC §6.3.

These are the single source of truth for "hard session", "resting HR delta",
"HRV vs baseline", "sleep is trustworthy" and the readiness verdict. The tools server, the eval ground
truth and the tests all import from here, so a definition can only change in one
place. Each rule is expressed twice -- once as a SQL fragment for DuckDB, once as
a Python predicate for row-level use -- and the tests assert the two agree.
